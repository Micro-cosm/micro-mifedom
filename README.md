# MicroMifedom

A request router that brings a touch of architecture to your otherwise disparate mifen, providing them a shared
subdomain, auth realm, and other fundamental services that can quickly bring your **Mifedom** to life

----

_NOTE:  With a shared common purpose, **we are quick to respond to hackathon use cases!**_

----

This repo is intended to unite Micro-cosm mifen.  By providing just one simple approach, in this case using the Firebase platform, the
hope is that loosely-coupled mifen reveal new ways to reason about complex systems.

This repo assumes access to a running GCP project with access from local installations of gcloud and Firebase CLI.

**Use freely, but please befit security rigor to purpose.**
