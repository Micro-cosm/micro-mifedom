# MicroMifedom

_A request router that brings a touch of architecture to your otherwise disparate mifen, providing them a shared
subdomain, auth realm, and other fundamental services that can quickly bring your **Mifedom** to life_

----

_NOTE: Given our shared common purpose, **we are quick to respond to your hackathon use case!**_

----

This sole purpose of this repo is to unite Micro-cosm projects. By demonstrating one approach, using the Firebase platform, we
hope to show how loosely-coupled mifen can fundamentally change how complex systems are delivered.

This repo assumes access to a running GCP project with access from local installations of gcloud and Firebase CLI.

**Use freely, but please apply security rigor to which your purpose **
